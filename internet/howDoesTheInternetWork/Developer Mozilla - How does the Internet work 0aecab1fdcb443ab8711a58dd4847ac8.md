### Summary

The Internet is the backbone of the Web - the technical infrastructure that makes the Web possible

At its most basic, the internet is a large network of computers which communicate all together

### A Simple Network

When you want to connect two computers together, you can link them physically (using an Ethernet cable) or wirelessly (Wi-Fi).

Let’s say you want to connect 10 computers together using Ethernet Cables. Each computer will need 9 plugs and you’ll need to connect them to each other using 45 cables! This obviously will get unwieldy and is NOT scalable.

To solve this problem, we use ******\*\*******routers******\*\******* - routers have one job and that’s to ensure the correct message from a given computer is sent to the right destination computer. Instead of having 45 cables and each computer having 9 plugs, each computer just needs ********************************\*\*\*\*********************************one plug and one cable connecting to a single router********************************\*\*\*\*********************************

### A Network of Networks

We can scale infinitely by connecting computers to routers and routers to each other.

The internet is a combination of this concept of routers AND building upon another existing infrastructure - electric power and telephone lines. These lines connect houses with each other. By using a tool called a ****\*\*****modem****\*\*****, information from our network can be turned into information manageable by the telephone infrastructure and vice versa.

The next problem to solve in this puzzle is sending information from our network to the network we want to reach. You will need to connect to an ******************************\*\*******************************ISP (Internet Service Provider)******************************\*\*******************************. An ISP is a company that manages **************\*\*\*\***************special routers that are all linked together and can access other ISP’s routers**************\*\*\*\***************.

Computer → Router → Modem → ISP1 → ISP2 → Modem → Router → Computer
