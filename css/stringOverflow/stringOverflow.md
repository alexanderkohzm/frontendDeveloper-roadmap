# String Overflow

# What is String Overflow?

String overflow is the case where the contents of a string exceed the available space of the element that contains it. This causes the string to extend past (overflow) the boundaries of the container and cause visual and layout issues.

This is typically caused when containers have a fixed size (height, width) and text that exceeds the amount of space in the container will overflow.

The question is, how can you handle it gracefully?

# Tactics to handle String Overflow

**1). CSS `text-overflow` and `overflow` properties**

One method to handle string overflow is through the CSS properties `text-overflow` and `overflow`. For example, if you set the following CSS properties to your element, the text that does not fit into the element will be shown as ellipses instead

```css
.card {
  text-overflow: ellipsis;
  overflow: hidden;
}
```

**2). Responsive design**

You could choose to handle text overflow through responsive designs. This means that depending on the window size/device that’s on the web page, you change the design of the components.

**2a). Responsive Typography**

You can implement typography techniques such as using **relative units** (e.g. `em` or `rem`) and media queries to adjust font sizes based on the available space. This helps to prevent string overflow on smaller screens

**3). Text wrapping**

You can choose to use CSS properties like `word-wrap` or `white-space` that can help wrap the text within the available space, preventing overflow

**4). Dynamic Sizing**

Layouts like flexbox or grid have containers that can be dynamically resized to fit its contents

**5). “Read More/Less” Functionality**

You could implement Read More/Less for your components so users can choose to show or hide the content

**6). Keep Accessibility in mind**

You should remember to keep accessibility in mind - ensure that the content remains accessible to users with disabilities. Verify that screen readers can properly read the truncated or hidden content and that any added interactivity (e.g. tooltips, expandable elements) can be navigated using assistive technologies
